Go and complete [markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

You will be using markdown a lot for github "readme" files. 

If you want to render markdown format while writing and before pushing to github, google "markdown editor YOUR_DISTRUBTION" and install whatever free version comes up. I'm using **ReText**. 

Please note that sometimes editors don't render the same way as github, in that case consider github variant the correct one.
