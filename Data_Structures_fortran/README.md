## P1.6 - Searching, Sorting, Data Structures

**Important note**: The lectures will only provide a summary of the relevant
content and cannot cover all details, thus it is highly advisable to study
the provided reference material (Modern Fortran Tutorial, Descriptions culled
from Wikipedia).

As a preparation, you can read through the
[Fortan Quickstart tutorial](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/).
This website also has reference documentation about Fortran intrinsics
and a "Fortran Playground" where you can try experiment with Fortran
code without installing a Fortran compiler locally.
